    <p>I'm at a bar. It's not like how they look in the movies.</p>
    <p>In movies, the volume is controlled. The background is out of focus.
      You can only hear a few people talking at once. All that you need to see is seen.</p>
    <p>But this is not a movie. It's a nightmare. Talking, laughing, shouting all around me(â€”)</p>
    <p>music blaring, chairs moving, glasses clinking, coming closer, attacking me from all sides.</p>
    <p>I can't think. I try to look for people I know.</p>
    <p>Their mouths are moving. I can't focus on what they're saying, only the moving of their lips,</p>
    <p>and people, dozens of people, everywhere, staring at me, knowing there's something wrong with me.</p>
    <p>I want to know what they know.</p>
    <p>My eyes start to water.</p>
    <p>It's no different from how I felt when I was a kid.</p>
